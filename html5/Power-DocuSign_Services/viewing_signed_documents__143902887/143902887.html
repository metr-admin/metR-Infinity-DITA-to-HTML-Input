      <p class="p">The documents that you send for eSignature, are signed and returned back to your agreement or quote/proposal. The documents will be returned to the related agreement or quote/proposal. This feature can be controlled by <strong class="ph b">Filter RSPC by Primary Agreement Status</strong> and <strong class="ph b">Update RSPC Agreement Status</strong> custom settings in Comply System Properties. These system properties work only if <strong class="ph b">Select Attachments for Related/Sibling</strong> custom setting in Comply System Properties is enabled. The Agreement Status of both Parent and Child Agreement will be updated after the documents are signed. For example, if you have a Primary Agreement and it has a Child Agreement; you send both agreements for signature. Once signed, the agreements are then returned to the related agreements in Notes &amp; Attachments section. </p>
      <p class="p">The signed documents are then stored in the <strong class="ph b">Files</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">Notes &amp; Attachments</strong> related lists of that agreement or quote/proposal. If you have enabled Version Aware for your agreement, they are stored in the <strong class="ph b">Document Version</strong> related list. </p>
      <p class="p">For more information on the custom settings, refer to
