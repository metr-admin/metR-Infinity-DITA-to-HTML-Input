      <p class="p">Using the Ball in Court feature, you can forward form information to a user of the project to obtain more information or approvals. The Ball in Court feature is primarily used when a stakeholder at a particular workflow stage of a form needs to send form information to a user who is not a stakeholder at the workflow stage of the form. The user receiving the forwarded form information can then respond to the initiator with the required information.</p>
      <p class="p">On initiating the ball in court utility in a form, a notificationemail is sent to the recipient, a notification is saved inthe<span class="ph uicontrol">INBOX</span>page of the recipient, and atask created in the application<span class="ph uicontrol">MY TASKS</span>page of the recipient. </p>
      <p class="p">The recipient can then respond to the initiator from the form from which the ball in court utility was initiated. On responding to the ball in court notification in a form, a notificationemail is sent to the initiator anda notification is saved in the<span class="ph uicontrol">INBOX</span>page of the initiator.</p>
      <p class="p">The notification emailsent from the initiator and the response notification email sent from recipient are configurable in the workflow associated with the form. The notification email templates can be configured to contain custom information, and also form information.</p>
      <p class="p">The high-level task sequence for the ball in court utility is as follows:</p>
      <div class="p">
         <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">Configure notification templates in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Mail Body Template</span> catalog of the Library.<span class="ph">For information on configuring the Mail Body Template, refer to <a class="xref" href="../../Library_Management/Standard_Library_Catalogs/Notifications/MailBodyTemps.html">Creating Mail Body Templates</a>.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li">Select the notification template to be sent to the recipient and the notification template to be sent to the initiator of the ball in court notification in the workflow of the form at the required workflow stage. <span class="ph">For information on configuring email templates, refer to <a class="xref" href="../../Administration/Configuration_Toolkit/Workflow_Management/CreateWFSimple.html">Configuring Ball in Court Notifications</a>.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li">Create the required form, and save the form.</li>
            <li class="li">Use the Ball in Court notification in the form. The initiator template configured in the workflow is sent to the recipient.</li>
            <li class="li">Use the Respond notification in the form that was used to initiate the Ball in Court notification. The recipient template configured in the workflow is sent to the initiator.</li>
         </ol>
