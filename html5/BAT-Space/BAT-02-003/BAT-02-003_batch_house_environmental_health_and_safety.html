                  <p class="p">Respirable Crystalline
              Silica (RCS) is one of the most impactful health concerns relative to Space Batch
              Houses. RCS primarily comes from the sand portion of the batch mix, which can become
              airborne anytime the batch material is not contained and/or disturbed during the
              process, cleaning, or maintenance activities. Airborne concentrations must be
              evaluated and controls put in place according to the Global EHS Respirable Silica
              Fundamental EHS-06-004.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="li">Each facility shall conduct a respirable crystalline silica (RCS)
            exposure assessment to determine the potential for employee exposure to RCS. The
            assessment shall be based on the potential RCS airborne concentrations for the jobs and
            tasks of similar exposure groups (SEGs).</li>
               <li class="li">Each facility shall prepare a sampling plan based upon the exposure
            assessment and the plan should cover planned sampling activities over the next 24 to 36
            months.</li>
               <li class="li">The assessment and sampling plan must be completed by a person
            competent in the practice of industrial hygiene.</li>
               <li class="li">Each facility shall institute a RCS medical surveillance program for
            all employees who are routinely exposed (i.e., 30 days per year) over the occupational
            (OEL) based on the results from the exposure assessment and the sampling plan.</li>
               <li class="li">Each facility shall have an exposure control plan, or its equivalent.
            An example is shown in Appendix B6 of EHS-06-004. The written plan shall contain the
            following elements:<ol class="ol" type="a" id="r1A68034-BB01-11F0-2476-09173F13E4C5__ol_sx3_qrs_4zb">

               </li>
               <li class="li">Regulated areas shall be established wherever exposure to airborne
            concentrations of RCS is (or can reasonably be expected to be) in excess of the

            must be marked, have limited access, and proper PPE must be worn to enter, which will
            include proper respiratory protection.</li>
               <li class="li">Airborne RCS and accumulations of dust shall be reduced by following
            good housekeeping practices and reporting leaks/spills to a supervisor. When completing

               <li class="li">The hierarchy of controls must be followed relative to RCS exposure.
            Engineering controls must be considered before the use of PPE. The RCS fundamental
            contains an internal Engineering Design Standard for new batch projects of 25 µg/m3
            8-hour TWA. <p class="p">Noise exposure in a Batch House is often greater than
              the applicable occupational exposure limits. Batch House employee are typically
              included in the site hearing conservation program. The requirements of the Hearing
              Conservation Program are contained in EHS-02-133.</p>

               <li class="li">The hierarchy of controls must be followed when levels exceed 85 dBA
            or a locally more stringent limit. Engineering controls, followed by administrative
            controls must be considered before choosing PPE as the last choice. </li>
               <li class="li">When choosing hearing protection devices (HPDs), the site must
            document that hearing protection is adequate based on the assessed noise levels and the

            Training shall include the risks of elevated noise exposure and proper use of hearing
            protection, at a minimum. <p class="p">Respiratory protection is required in the
              Batch House when engineering and administrative controls fail to control RCS (and
              sometimes other contaminants) below occupational exposure limits and sometimes during
              the completion of specified tasks. The requirements of the Global Respiratory
              Protection Fundamental is contained in EHS-06-009.</p>

               <li class="li">Negative pressure respirators (i.e., filtering face piece, half and
            full face cartridge) respirators require the user to have a documented fit test before
            initial use and periodically after in accordance to EHS-06-009.</li>
               <li class="li">Each site must have a policy in place requiring that nothing
            (including facial hair) interfere with the seal of a negative pressure respirator. A
            positive pressure respirator (i.e., PAPR) that does not rely on a facial seal can be
            worn where compliance cannot be met with the use of a negative pressure respirator.</li>
               <li class="li">Respirators must be properly maintained, stored, discarded, and have
            a documented cartridge change schedule. The cartridge change schedule is based upon the
            contaminate levels in the work area and indicates when the cartridge should be
            changed.</li>
               <li class="li">The requirement to wear a respirator must be posted on signs in the
            work area and/or work area entrance.</li>
               <li class="li">Employees must receive annual respiratory protection training that
            meets local regulatory requirements and the requirements contained in EHS-06-009.<p class="p">Temperature extremes in a the Batch House varies based on the sites
              location and seasonal changes. Each site must assess the potential temperature
              extremes and implement actions as necessary in compliance with Heat Related Illness
              EHS-02-134.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="li">Each site must complete an assessment to identify employees and tasks
            that put employees at risk for heat stress. The assessment must meet the requirements
            contained in EHS-02-134 or the local legal requirements if more stringent. </li>
               <li class="li">A written site specific program should be available detailing how the
            site manages areas or tasks identified at risk during the assessment.</li>
               <li class="li">When areas or tasks are identified at risk, then additional
            provisions for water consumption and cooling areas must be provided per EHS-02-134.</li>
               <li class="li">Medical surveillance must be implemented where there is a local legal
            requirement.</li>
               <li class="li">Documented training must be provided annually for all supervisors of
            employees and employees who have been identified at risk during the assessment. The
            training must cover, as a minimum, all of the topics contained in EHS-02-134 and as
            locally required. <p class="p">The Batch House has a number of raw materials and
              other chemicals available for use with potentials for personal employee exposure and
              exposure to the environment. Each site must ensure the safe and proper use of
              hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and must comply with locally applicable
              regulations addressing the storage and disposal of these chemicals, and the
              requirements contained in Chemical Management EHS-02-123.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="li">Each site must have a system in place to identify and review chemical
            uses for all existing and new chemicals. The assessment must take into account the
            safety of the chemical, potential exposure to employees, exposure to the environment,
            proper storage, and proper disposal. The review and assessment process must meet the
            requirements contained within EHS-02-123 and any local legal requirement.</li>
               <li class="li">The site must have a current list of all chemical substance and a

              infrequently visited for various tasks and at different lighting levels. Site lighting
              levels should be in compliance with Illumination OIES-L-001 or local requirements if
              more stringent.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="li">Each site should review the Global Engineering lighting requirements
            in Illumination OIES-L-001. A plan should be in place to meet the minimum illumination
            requirements. A system must be in place to promptly replace faulty lighting fixtures and
            burnt out bulbs.</li>
