                        <li class="li">The site shall use the same types of road markings as on public roads to regulate traffic flow (e.g., white and yellow lines). Markings may be made reflective for improved visibility.</li>

                              <li class="li">Vehicle reversing alarms shall be fitted. Alarms must be kept in working order and must be loud and distinct enough to be heard above background noise. </li>
                              <li class="li">In some circumstances, (e.g. where a reversing alarm might not be easy to hear), visible systems such as flashing warning beacons or lights shall be used. </li>

                        <li class="li">Before using a signaler, the site shall assess the risks banksmen will be exposed to, and take precautions to protect them.</li>

                        <li class="li">Parking areas shall be level, firm, well lit, well drained and clearly marked. Where vehicles have to be parked on a slope, they must have their parking brakes applied, be left in gear (where safe to do so) and wheel chocks must be used where appropriate.</li>
                        <li class="li">Drivers shall never leave their vehicle without ensuring that the vehicle and its trailer are securely braked, the engine is stopped, the starter key removed, and any mounted equipment lowered to the ground.</li>
                        <li class="li">Trailer parking brakes shall be used. Signs, instructions, or any other measures must be used to make sure drivers brake their trailers properly.</li>
                        <li class="li">On large goods vehicles, trailer emergency brakes shall never be relied on in place of the parking brakes. Tractor unit brakes are not designed to make trailers safe.</li>

                        <li class="li">Space sites and the Space logistic providers shall ensure that the site operations ensure areas where vehicles are coupled and uncoupled are well lit (by natural or artificial light), firm, and level. Vehicle stops, handholds and lighting (e.g. at the cab rear) must be provided and used where appropriate. Drivers must be properly instructed in coupling procedures and safety.</li>
                        <li class="li">Where vehicles must be ‘split coupled’ or ‘close coupled’ because of lack of room between the trailer and tractor unit, the trailer parking brake shall be properly applied before coupling or uncoupling.</li>
                        <li class="li">When uncoupling, drivers shall normally follow the coupling procedure in reverse. Drivers must make sure that the ground is hard standing (i.e., firm enough to hold the trailer and its legs), and that the cab brakes are applied before getting out.</li>
