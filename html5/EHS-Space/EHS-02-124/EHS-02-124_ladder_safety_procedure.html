   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The purpose of this procedure is to identify the minimum requirements for Ladder Safety procedures at Space facilities. All employees and contractors who might be expected to use a ladder during the course of work should be familiar with this procedure. This procedure covers all types of ladders, including step ladders, extension ladders, and fixed ladders. Ladder users must be able to recognize and avoid ladder hazards while being aware of safe practices in setting up, storing, moving and working from this equipment.</p>
