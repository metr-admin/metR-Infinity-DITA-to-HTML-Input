         <li class="li">The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on retrieval of employees in the event a fall has occurred when working at heights (e.g., roofs, inside buildings, etc.).</li>
         <li class="li">After a fall, the worker remains suspended in the air and will need to be rescued by others. It is important to the safety of the employee for a quick retrieval to occur to prevent any further injury to the employee. Leaving a worker suspended for a long period of time can be dangerous to their health and safety. In other situations, the employee could have injuries that require first-aid or medical assistance. A rescue plan will detail how to return fallen workers to a place of safety while keeping rescuers safe.</li>
