   <div class="body conbody">
      <ol class="ol">
         <li class="li">The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the protection of employees from respiratory hazards, through proper use of respirators. In addition, this procedure was developed to control those occupational diseases caused by breathing air contaminated with harmful particulates, fogs, fumes, mists, gases, smokes, sprays, or vapors.</li>
         <li class="li">The primary objective of all Space locations is to prevent atmospheric releases, as far as feasible, through accepted control measures. When effective controls are not feasible, or while they are being established, appropriate respirators are to be used as detailed in this procedure.</li>
      </ol>

   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Application</h2>
   
   
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">This procedure applies to all Space employees, contractors and visitors, and all operations including manufacturing facilities, technical centers, offices, and administrative buildings where respirators may be required for certain tasks.</p>

   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">Scope</h2>
   
   
   <div class="body conbody">
      <ol class="ol">
         <li class="li">Engineering systems, work practice and administrative controls, and chemical substitution (e.g., general and local ventilation, enclosure or confinement of the operation, substitution of less toxic materials) are the preferred methods for controlling atmospheric hazards. Respirators are only to be used if these methods are not feasible.</li>
         <li class="li">All required respirators will be issued at no charge to the employee.</li>
