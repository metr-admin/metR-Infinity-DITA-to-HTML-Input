                        <li class="li">Do not drive fasteners into very hard or brittle material that might chip or splatter or make the fasteners ricochet.</li>
                        <li class="li">Always use an alignment guide when shooting fasteners into existing holes.</li>
                        <li class="li">When using a high-velocity tool, do not drive fasteners more than 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from an unsupported edge or corner of material such as brick or concrete.</li>
                        <li class="li">When using a high-velocity tool, do not place fasteners in steel any closer than 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) from an unsupported corner edge unless a special guard, fixture, or jig is used.</li>

                  <li class="li">The fluid used in hydraulic power tools shall be an approved fire-resistant fluid and must retain its operating characteristics at the most extreme temperatures to which it will be exposed.</li>
                  <li class="li">The exception to fire-resistant fluid involves all hydraulic fluids used for the insulated sections of derrick trucks, aerial lifts, and hydraulic tools that are used on or around energized lines. This hydraulic fluid shall be of the insulating type.</li>
                  <li class="li">The manufacturer’s recommended safe operating pressure for hoses, valves, pipes, filters, and other fittings shall not be exceeded.</li>
                  <li class="li">All jacks—including lever and ratchet jacks, screw jacks, and hydraulic jacks—shall have a stop indicator, and the stop limit must not be exceeded. Also, the manufacturer’s load limit shall be permanently marked in a prominent place on the jack, and the load limit must not be exceeded.</li>
                  <li class="li">A jack shall never be used to support a lifted load. Once the load has been lifted, it must immediately be blocked up by putting a block under the base of the jack when the foundation is not firm, and placing a block between the jack cap and load if the cap might slip.</li>
                  <li class="li">To set up a jack, make certain of the following:<ol class="ol" type="i">
                        <li class="li">The base of the jack shall rest on a firm, level surface;</li>
                        <li class="li">The jack shall be correctly centered;</li>
                        <li class="li">The jack head shall bear against a level surface; and</li>
                        <li class="li">The lift force shall be applied evenly.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li class="li">All jacks shall be lubricated regularly. In addition, each jack shall be inspected according to the following schedule: (1) for jacks used continuously or intermittently at one site—inspected at least once every 6 months, (2) for jacks sent out of the shop for special work—inspected when sent out and inspected when returned, and (3) for jacks subjected to abnormal loads or shock—inspected before use and immediately thereafter.</li>
