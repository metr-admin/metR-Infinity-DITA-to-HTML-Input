   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The purpose of the Space Hearing Conservation Program is to minimize occupational hearing loss by providing hearing protection, training, and annual hearing tests to all persons working in areas or with equipment that have noise levels equal to or exceeding an action level of 85 decibels (dB) as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), or local legislative action level, whichever is more stringent.</p>

            <li class="li">Noise Exposure Evaluation<ol class="ol" type="a">
                  <li class="li">Each facility shall be evaluated by a certified Industrial Hygienist, or regional equivalent (e.g., qualified noise assessors, etc.), for the purpose of determining the scope of its Hearing Conservation Program.</li>
                  <li class="li">The evaluation shall be accomplished by a Sound Pressure Level Grid Survey or a Dosimetry Study as determined by the facility’s Regional EHS Manager. All noise exposure monitoring results shall be retained by the plant.</li>
                  <li class="li">These evaluations shall be conducted initially at each facility and repeated whenever a change in production, process, equipment, or controls increase noise exposures.<ol class="ol" type="i">
                        <li class="li">Evaluations shall be conducted every 10 years, or according to local regulations, whichever is more stringent, if and when there are no changes in production, process, equipment, or controls that would increase the noise level of the area.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
               </ol>

            <li class="li">Controls<ol class="ol" type="a">
                  <li class="li">Preference shall be placed on implementing engineering controls to reduce noise levels. Engineering controls involve modifying and replacing equipment, or making related physical changes at the noise source or along the transmission path to reduce the noise level at the employee’s ear.<ol class="ol" type="i">
                        <li class="li">Examples of effective engineering controls include:
                     <ol class="ol">
                              <li class="li">Choosing low-noise tools and machinery; 	
                        </li>
                              <li class="li">Maintaining and lubricating machinery and equipment (e.g., oil bearings); </li>
                              <li class="li">Placing a barrier between the noise source and employee (e.g., sound walls or curtains); and </li>
                              <li class="li">Enclosing or isolating the noise source.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li class="li">When engineering controls are not feasible, administrative controls shall be implemented. Administrative controls are changes in the workplace or schedule that reduce or eliminate the employee’s exposure to noise.<ol class="ol" type="i">
                        <li class="li">Examples of administrative controls include:
                        <ol class="ol">
                              <li class="li">Operating noisy machines during shifts when fewer people are exposed; 
                        </li>
                              <li class="li">Limiting the amount of time a person spends at a noise source;</li>
                              <li class="li">Providing quiet areas where workers can gain relief from hazardous noise sources; and</li>
                              <li class="li">Controlling noise exposure through distance is often an effective, yet simple and inexpensive administrative control. Specifically, for every doubling of the distance between the source of noise and the worker, the noise is decreased by 6 dB.</li>
                           </ol>
                        </li>

                  </li>
                  <li class="li">When engineering controls nor administrative controls are feasible, personal protective equipment shall be used in the form of hearing protection.<ol class="ol" type="i">
                        <li class="li">Appropriate hearing protection shall be provided by each facility for employees required to wear hearing protection.</li>
                        <li class="li">Each facility shall provide employees with the opportunity to select from a variety of suitable hearing protectors. Hearing protection at the plant shall be evaluated and approved by the Regional EHS Manager.</li>
                        <li class="li">The proper wearing of hearing protection in designated (posted) areas shall be enforced in accordance with established disciplinary procedures.</li>
                        <li class="li">Hearing protection effectiveness shall be evaluated at the discretion of the Regional EHS Manager.</li>

            <li class="li">Employee Training<ol class="ol" type="a">
                  <li class="li">Training shall be provided to affected employees prior to the assignment of tasks which may result in exposure to noise greater than or equal to 85 decibels based upon an eight hour time-weighted average (TWA), or local legislative action level, whichever is more stringent.</li>
                  <li class="li">Training shall include the risks of elevated noise exposure and proper use of hearing protection, at a minimum.</li>
                  <li class="li">Retraining shall be conducted annually and documented.</li>

                  <li class="li">Approved hearing protection is required in all areas where the 8-hour TWA noise level is 85 dB or greater, or regional legislative 8-hour TWA, whichever is more stringent. These areas shall be posted in such a manner that they are readily recognized as a hearing protection required area by all who enter.</li>

                        <li class="li">Monitor – audiometric test after the first (baseline) audiogram.
