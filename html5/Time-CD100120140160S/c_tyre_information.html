      <p class="p">Explosions of air-inflated tyres have resulted from heat-induced
gas combustion inside the tyres. The heat, generated by welding or
heating rim components, external fire, or excessive use of brakes
can cause gaseous combustion.</p>
      <p class="p">A tyre explosion is much more violent than a blowout. The
explosion can propel the tyre, rim and axle components as far as
500 m (1500 ft) or more from the lift truck. Both the force of the
explosion and the flying debris can cause personal injury or death,
and property damage.</p>

      <p class="p">Do not approach a warm tyre closer than the outside of the area
represented by the shaded area in the above drawing.</p>
      <p class="p">Dry nitrogen(N2) gas is recommended for inflation of tyres. If
the tyres were originally inflated with air, nitrogen is still
preferred for adjusting the pressure. Nitrogen mixes properly with
air.</p>
      <p class="p">Nitrogen inflated tyres reduce the potential of a tyre
explosion, because nitrogen does not support combustion. Also,
nitrogen helps prevent oxidation and the resulting deterioration of
rubber and corrosion of rim components.</p>
      <p class="p">Proper nitrogen inflation equipment and training in its use are
necessary to avoid over inflation. A tyre blowout or rim failure
can result from improper or misused equipment.</p>
      <p class="p">Stand behind the tread and use a self-attaching chuck when
inflation a tyre.</p>
      <p class="p">Servicing, changing tyres and rims can be dangerous and should
be done only by trained personnel using proper tools and
procedures. If correct procedures are not followed while servicing
tyres and rims, the assemblies could burst with explosive force and
cause serious personal injury or death. Follow carefully the
specific information provided by your tyre or rim servicing
personnel or branch.</p>
      <p class="p">Time forklift is equipped with wheels from different
manufacturers.</p>
      <p class="p">Please re-use the original parts of the existing wheel, if there
is no deformation of the wheel after checked. Mixing up new and old
parts may cause incomplete assembly that might lead to unexpected
dismantlement of parts and accident.</p>
