   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p"> This document describes how to improve server performance using the AUTOGEN utility of HP
         OpenVMS on the Integrity Server FSC (Forming Supervisory Computer). This tuning procedure
         can also be performed on  Alphaserver and MicroVAX servers but should not be necessary.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <ol class="ol">
         <li class="li">This work instruction applies to all Space Plants that has FSC and Space IS Machines.</li>
         <li class="li">The procedure helps to mitigate a problem with TCP/IP communication indicated when frequent COM-SOC II error messages occur during automatic or manual Saves from the sections (not MOC Save).</li>
         <li class="li">If the FSC shares the server with the PIC application (called a Combo system), this procedure should not be necessary because it is part of every upgrade. Consult the personnel responsible for the PIC to determine when the procedure was last performed.</li>

                  <li class="li">If the FSC is a DEC MicroVAX or Compaq Alphaserver, use the console terminal or
                     PC terminal emulator connected to the console port. The console device is
                     typically in the immediate vicinity of the FSC. Go to step <a class="xref" href="FES-03-102_integrity_server_performance_tuning.html#r1FBFD5A-BB01-11F0-1440-09173F13E4C5__li_qnl_j5x_pzb">5</a> when you have identified the console

                     device next to the FSC, or use a terminal emulator to connect to the Integrity
                     Server Management Port.</li>
                  <li class="li">If necessary, log on as user “Oper” with the password “console”.</li>
                  <li class="li">At the Management Port Main Menu, type “<kbd class="ph userinput">co</kbd>” and press
                        <span class="ph uicontrol">Enter</span> to connect to the VMS Console.</li>

                        <kbd class="ph userinput">Ctrl-w</kbd>. If there is a message saying that you have
                     read-only access, perform the following three-character sequence shown in
                     parentheses to take control (Ctrl-e, c, f). Hold the Ctrl key down only when
                     typing the letter “<kbd class="ph userinput">e</kbd>”. Type all three characters in the

                     response. The console could be logged off in which case you will be prompted
                     for a Username, or the console could be logged onto the FSC menu by the person
                     responsible for backups.<ol class="ol" type="i" id="r1FBFD5A-BB01-11F0-1440-09173F13E4C5__ol_hbq_lzx_pzb">

                     appropriate backup within the capabilities of the FSC server model. If the FSC
                     is an HP Integrity Server with FSC version 6.1-0 or later installed, one option
                     is to clone the system drive to the backup drive as described in

                  <li class="li">If the console is already running the FSC user application menu, it might already be at the Backup menu or still waiting for a typed response to complete a backup.  In the case of the latter, respond appropriately to navigate to the Backup menu so that you can start a new backup.    <ol class="ol" type="i">
