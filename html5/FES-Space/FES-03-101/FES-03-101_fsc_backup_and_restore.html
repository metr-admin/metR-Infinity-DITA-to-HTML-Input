         <p class="p">To define a work instruction for describing the new scheme and procedures for backing up
            the FSC (Forming Supervisory Computer) to a spare drive or a USB memory device. Backups
            should be done on a regular basis to protect against extended FSC downtime. Also
            described are the restore procedures for performing an emergency recovery by booting
            from the spare drive, or by loading a backup image from a USB device to a replacement
            hard drive in the event both the operating and backup drives have failed.</p>

         <p class="p">This work instruction applies to all Space Plants that has FSC and Space IS Machines.</p>

            <p class="p">It is highly recommended that you always use the server console terminal for making
               the backups. Following this practice avoids the risk that the backup will be
               corrupted. Using a telnet session directly to the FSC (instead of the Integrity
               console) introduces the possibility that the session could be interrupted by network
               or PC problems. That kind of interruption immediately stops the backup before it can
               be completed and leaves you with a corrupted (unusable) result.</p>

                  <li class="li">Two new backup options are available to supplement the magnetic tape option
                     for plants with Integrity server based FSCs. The new options are located within
                     the legacy FSC Utilities Menu that can be accessed from either the console
                     terminal or via network telnet protocol. These options provide the following
                        functionality:<ol class="ol" type="i" id="r1FA557A-BB01-11F0-9728-09173F13E4C5__ol_hnm_jpx_pzb">
                        <li class="li">The operating hard drive can be cloned to the spare hard drive. This can
                           be done manually as often as desired to ensure up-to-date data on the
                           spare drive. The Clone option will also work on Alpha Servers if an
                           operating spare drive is available.</li>
                        <li class="li">The spare hard drive can be backed up onto USB flash drives. This is a
                           unique capability of the Integrity server that is not available on
                           earlier Alpha Servers.</li>

                  <li class="li">All FSCs that have been deployed on the Integrity platform contain a spare
                     hard drive which is intended to be the fastest way to get the FSC back into
                     operation in the event of a system hard drive failure. Therefore, frequent
                     cloning to the spare drive helps your plant ensure that:<ol class="ol" type="i" id="r1FA557A-BB01-11F0-9728-09173F13E4C5__ol_inm_jpx_pzb">
                        <li class="li">Operational data such as the active jobs and COM-SOC 2 boot assignments
                           are as recent as possible.</li>
                        <li class="li">The spare drive is in good working condition just in case there is a
                           failure.</li>
                        <li class="li">On a Combo system where the FSC is sharing the server with a PIC, the
                           database for the PIC has a current backup on the spare drive.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li class="li">Hardware errors that might be noted during the clone procedure should be acted
                     upon promptly by getting the malfunctioning drive checked out by your repair
                     service provider and replaced before an unexpected shutdown occurs.</li>
                  <li class="li">In the severe situation where both hard drives have to be replaced and
                     reloaded, it will be necessary to boot to the Standalone Backup disk. The menu
                     on the Standalone Backup system allows restoring from either a tape or a USB
                     drive backup that was made as a safety contingency. The new USB backup
                     procedure uses the spare hard drive as the source and then performs a
                     verification to ensure that the backup is reliable.<ol class="ol" type="i" id="r1FA557A-BB01-11F0-9728-09173F13E4C5__ol_jnm_jpx_pzb">
                        <li class="li">The procedure will check the spare hard drive to ensure that it has been
                           cloned from the system hard drive within the past two days.</li>
                        <li class="li">This test ensures that the more important image on the spare drive is
                           current.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li class="li">It is recommended to obtain between seven to ten USB drives (16GB should be
                     sufficient) so that you can use a different drive each day in rotation. If the
                     basic drive size is too small, the backup utility will tell you. Keep track of
                     the dates on which you use each drive so that you can always tell which was the
                     most recent (for a recovery), or which was the oldest (for the next backup).<ol class="ol" type="i" id="r1FA557A-BB01-11F0-9728-09173F13E4C5__ol_knm_jpx_pzb">
                        <li class="li">Conventional tags used to identify equipment status can be attached with
                           the wire to a lanyard hole in the drive. You can log dates right on the
                           tags when they are used for a backup. Tip: Write a warning on the tag
                           that the drive should never be plugged into a PC to see what is on it.
                           The PC will want to format the drive and that erases the backup(s) on
                           it.</li>
                        <li class="li">You might be able to write an indelible ID number on the drives with a
                           fine point felt marker. Keep a log book showing the date/time and ID
                           number each time a backup is made. Tip: Store the drives in a container
                           marked with the warning to never plug them into a PC due to possible
                           erasure</li>

                                    would not be a source option.</li>

                                    with the PIC application (called a Combo system), the backup
                                    would take longer and generate a larger backup file. If the
                                    system utilizes OpenVMS 8.3, the file cannot be compressed so
                                    the file size and backup time will be significantly
                                    increased.</li>
