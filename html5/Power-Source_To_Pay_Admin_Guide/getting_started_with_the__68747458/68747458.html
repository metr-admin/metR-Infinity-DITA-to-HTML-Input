   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">A Wizard Design can be as complex or simple as required, allowing your users to create a
            basic records or populate second and third-level items conditionally based on input or
            step rules. </p>
      <p class="p">A Wizard Design is comprised of the following key components:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">Inputs</strong> – Input are the primary wizard component of any wizard. They
                are the questions and instructions that you provide to the end users of the wizard
                at runtime. The values received from the end user are stored as Inputs. For example,
                you might create an input that requires users to select options from a picklist,
                such as a Business Function or Agreement Start and End dates. Inputs are reusable,
                so you can use them in as many steps as you want to.</li>
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">Steps</strong> – Inputs are placed in Steps in the desired sequence for runtime
                use. Steps will also contain rules which are used to designate the navigation flow,
                the object and submission actions, which are determined and executed based on the
                end user responses at runtime.</li>
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">Step Input Rules</strong> – These rules allow you to configure rules and
                expressions for your Inputs at Wizard runtime. Input rule types can be configured to
                enable/disable or show/hide Inputs, or to conditionally determine the focus object
                of the Wizard (e.g., Agreement) or conditionally determine the record type for the
                focus object's record to be created (e.g., SOW, NDA, MSA, etc.), or to set the
                value of one input based on the value of other inputs.</li>
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">Wizard Step Rules</strong> – These rules control the flow of Wizard steps at
                runtime. You can create "GoTo" rules for your steps which determine step
                order in the Wizard based on runtime user responses. The rules you create can be
                assigned as default for individual steps and can be made conditional based on
                expressions you create for each rule, using values from Inputs to determine whether
                or not rules are fired for any given step.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">The following sections describe the Wizard design process, from initial settings to input
            and steps, including guidance on how to create your own Inputs and Steps during design
            and how to use and maintain the Wizard Component Library. The Agreement object is used
            as the focus object in most Wizard examples, but the same instructions can be used to
            create a Wizard based on <strong class="ph b">Account, Opportunity</strong> or any <strong class="ph b">custom Salesforce
                object</strong>.</p>
