         <p class="p">The limited warranty
provided by Schneider Electric in this Statement of Limited Factory
Warranty applies only to products you purchase for your commercial
or industrial use in the ordinary course of your business.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Terms of Warranty</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Schneider Electric warrants
that the product shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship
for a period of one year from the date of product start-up when start-up
is performed by Schneider Electric-authorized service personnel and
occurs within six months of the Schneider Electric shipment date.
This warranty covers repairing or replacing any defective parts including
on-site labor and travel. In the event that the product fails to meet
the foregoing warranty criteria, the warranty covers repairing or
replacing defective parts at the sole discretion of Schneider Electric
for a period of one year from the shipment date. For Schneider Electric
cooling solutions, this warranty does not cover circuit breaker resetting,
loss of refrigerant, consumables, or preventive maintenance items.
Repair or replacement of a defective product or part thereof does
not extend the original warranty period. Any parts furnished under
this warranty may be new or factory-remanufactured.</p>

for whom the Schneider Electric product specified herein has been
purchased. This warranty is not transferable or assignable without
the prior written permission of Schneider Electric.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assignment of Warranties</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Schneider Electric
will assign you any warranties which are made by manufacturers and
suppliers of components of the Schneider Electric product and which
are assignable. Any such warranties are assigned “AS IS”
and Schneider Electric makes no representation as to the effectiveness
or extent of such warranties, assumes no responsibility for any matters
which may be warranted by such manufacturers or suppliers and extends
no coverage under this Warranty to such components.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Drawings, Descriptions</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Schneider Electric

Published Specifications or any of the drawings certified and agreed
to by contract with Schneider Electric if applicable thereto (“Specifications”).

and not warranties of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exclusions</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Schneider Electric shall not
be liable under the warranty if its testing and examination disclose
that the alleged defect in the product does not exist or was caused
by end user or any third person misuse, negligence, improper installation
or testing. Further, Schneider Electric shall not be liable under
the warranty for unauthorized attempts to repair or modify wrong or
inadequate electrical voltage or connection, inappropriate on-site
operation conditions, corrosive atmosphere, repair, installation,
start-up by non-Schneider Electric designated personnel, a change
in location or operating use, exposure to the elements, Acts of God,
fire, theft, or installation contrary to Schneider Electric recommendations
or specifications or in any event if the Schneider Electric serial
