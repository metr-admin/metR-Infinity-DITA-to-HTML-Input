alarm is activated. If the batteries are depleted, the system transfers
to bypass operation if the bypass source is available and within tolerance.
If the input source or the bypass source are still unavailable, the
UPS system will turn off and stop supplying the load, but if <span class="ph uicontrol">Auto Start</span> is configured for the UPS system, then the
UPS will automatically restart and return to normal operation again
as soon as the input source is recovered.
