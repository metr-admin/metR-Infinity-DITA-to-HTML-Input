      <p class="p">Most accidents involving product operation, maintenance and
repair are caused by failure to observe basic safety rules or
precautions. An accident can often be avoided by recognizing
potentially hazardous situations before an accident occurs. A
person must be alert to potential hazards, and use common sense.
Persons must also have the necessary training, skills and tools
before attempting to perform these functions.</p>
      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">Improper operation, lubrication, maintenance or repair of this product can be dangerous
                        and could result in injury or death.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">Do not operate or perform any lubrication, maintenance or repair on this product, until
                        you have read and understood the operation, lubrication, maintenance and
                        repair information.</strong>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">Safety precautions and warnings are provided in this manual and on the product. If these
                        hazard warnings are not heeded, bodily injury or death could occur to you or
                        other persons.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="p">The hazards are identified by the “Safety Alert
Symbol” and followed by a “Signal Word” such as
“WARNING” as shown below.</p>
      <div class="note warning note_warning"><span class="note__title">Warning:</span> <div class="note__body">
         <p class="p">The meaning of this safety alert symbol is as follows:</p>
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Attention! Become Alert! Your Safety is involved.</strong>
         </p>
         <p class="p">The message that appears under the warning, explaining the hazard, can be
            either written or pictorially presented.</p>
         <p class="p">Operations that may cause product damage are identified by NOTICE labels on
            the product and in this publication.</p>
         <p class="p">Time cannot anticipate every possible circumstance that might involve a
            potential hazard, and common sense is always required. The warnings in this publication
            and on the product are therefore not all inclusive. Before any tool, procedure, work
            method or operating technique not specifically recommended by Time is used, you must be
            sure that it is safe for you and others. You should also ensure that the product will
            not be damaged or made unsafe by the operation, lubrication, maintenance or repair
            procedures you choose.</p>
         <p class="p">The information, specifications, and illustration in this publication are on
            the basis of information available at the time it was written. The specifications,
            torques, pressures, measurements, adjustments, illustrations, and other items can change
            at any time. These changes can affect the service given to the product. Obtain the
            complete and most current information before starting any job. Time branches have the
            most current information available.</p>
