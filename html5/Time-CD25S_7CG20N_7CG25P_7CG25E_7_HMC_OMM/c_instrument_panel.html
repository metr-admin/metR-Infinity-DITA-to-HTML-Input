      <p class="p">Your lift truck may not have the same indicator or warning lights as shown in the
      illustrations. Due to the various options available, typical instrument panels are shown.</p>
      <p class="p">However, the symbols on the indicators and lights on your panel identify what those
      particular items are. Also, the symbol for each of the items is identified and an explanation
      of their function and location is described on the following pages.</p>

         <strong class="ph b">1. Diesel Engine Water in Fuel Filter Indicator Light –</strong> Indicates when the engine is
         running, there is water in the fuel filter exceeds 100cc.</p>
      <p class="p">The light will come ON when the ignition switch is turned to the ON position. The light
      should go off after the engine is started. If the light turns on with the engine running, park
      the lift truck and stop the engine.</p>
      <p class="p">Drain some fuel (and any water) until clean fuel flows from the filter which approximately
      takes 5 to 6 seconds.</p>

      operational. The light will come on when the ignition switch is turned to the ON position.</p>
      <p class="p">The light should go off after the engine is started, indicating the alternator is producing
      sufficient voltage to charge the battery. If the light turns on with the engine running, check
      the alternator charging system for a malfunction.</p>

      turned to the ON position from the OFF position. This indicates that the glow plugs are
      preheating the pre-combustion chambers for easier starting.</p>
      <p class="p">The amount of time needed to preheat the pre-combustion chambers is approximately seven
      seconds, depending on the surrounding air temperature. When the light goes OFF the maximum
      pre-combustion chamber temperature has been reached and the key can be turned to the START
      position to start the engine.</p>

         <strong class="ph b">7. Engine Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) –</strong> Engine control system is equipped with
      built-in fault diagnostics. Detected system faults can be displayed by the Malfunction
      Indicator Lamp (MIL) as Diagnostic Fault Codes (DFC) or flash codes, and viewed in detail with
      the use of service tool software. When the ignition key is turned ON the MIL will perform a
      self-test, illuminate once and then go OFF. If a detected fault condition exists, the fault or
      faults will be stored in the memory of the engine control unit (ECM). Once a fault occurs the
      MIL will light up and remain ON. This signals the operator that a fault has been detected by
      the SCEM.</p>
