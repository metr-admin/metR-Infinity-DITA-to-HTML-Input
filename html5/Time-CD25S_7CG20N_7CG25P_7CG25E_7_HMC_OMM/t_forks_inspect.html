         <p class="p">Forks should be inspected, at a minimum, every 12 months. If the truck is being used
        in a multi-shift or heavy duty operation, they should be checked every six
        months.</p>
         <p class="p">Inspect the forks carefully for cracks. Special attention should be given to
        the heel section (A), all weld areas and mounting brackets (B). Inspect the top and bottom
        hooks on forks used on hook type carriages and tubes on shaft mounted forks.</p>
         <p class="p">Forks
        with cracks should be removed from service.</p>
         <p class="p">"Wet Test" magnetic particle inspection is
        generally preferred due to its sensitivity and the ease of interpreting the results.
        Portable equipment is usually recommended so it can be moved to the lift
        truck.</p>
         <p class="p">Inspectors should be trained and qualified in accordance with The American
        Society for Non Destructive Testing, Level II Qualifications.</p>

         <p class="p">Check the angle between the upper face of the blade and the front face of the shank.
        The fork should be withdrawn from service if angle (C) exceeds 93 degrees or deviates by
        more than 3 degrees from an original angle other than 90 degrees, as may be found in some
        special application forks.</p>

            <img class="image" src="media/image989.png">

         <p class="p">Check the straightness of the upper face of blade (D) and the front face of shank (E)
        with a straight edge.</p>
         <p class="p">The fork should be withdrawn from service if the deviation from
        straightness exceeds 0.5 percent of the length of the blade and/or the height of the shank
        respectively 5 mm/1000 mm (0.18"/36").</p>

            <img class="image" src="media/image990.png">

         <p class="p">Check the difference in height of one fork tip to the other when mounted on the fork
        carrier. A difference in fork tip height can result in uneven support of the load and cause
        problems with entering loads.</p>
         <p class="p">The maximum recommended difference in fork tip elevation
        (F) is 6.5 mm (0.25") for pallet forks and 3 mm (0.125") for fully tapered forks. The
        maximum allowable difference in fork tip elevation between the two or more forks is 3
        percent of blade length (L).</p>
         <p class="p">Replace one or both forks when the difference in fork tip
        height exceeds the maximum allowable difference. Contact your local Time Lift Truck Branch
        for further information.</p>

         <p class="p">Check the fork blade (J) and shank (H) for wear with special attention to the heel
        (G). The fork should be withdrawn from service if the thickness is reduced to 90 percent or
        less of the original thickness.</p>
         <p class="p">Fork blade length may also be reduced by wear,
        especially on tapered forks and platens. Remove the forks from service when the blade length
        is no longer adequate for the intended loads.</p>

            <img class="image" src="media/image992.png">
         </figure>
         <p class="p">Check the fork mountings (K) for wear, crushing and other local deformation, which
        can cause excessive side to side wobble of the forks.</p>
         <p class="p">Excessive clearance on hook type
        forks may allow them to fall from the carrier. Forks which show visible signs of such damage
        should be removed from service.</p>
         <p class="p">Check the positioning lock and other fork retention
        devices to make sure they are in place and working.</p>
         <p class="p">Hook type forks use a spring
        loaded pin (M), located in the top hook, to engage notches in the top carriage bar to hold
        the fork in place.</p>
         <p class="p">When adjusting the fork spacing, the forks are prevented from
        sliding off the end of the carriage by stop blocks. These stop blocks are at both ends of
        the carriage and in the path of the bottom fork hook. The load backrest extension may be
        used in place of the stop blocks in some cases.</p>
         <p class="p">Shaft mounted forks may use set
        collars or spacers on the shaft to either side of the fork. They may also use U bolts, pins,
        or similar devices which engage the fork through the top structure of the carriage.</p>

         <p class="p">Check fork markings (N) for legibility. Renew markings as required to retain
        legibility.</p>

            <span class="ph cmd">Lift the mast and operate the tilt control lever, until the top surface of the forks is
