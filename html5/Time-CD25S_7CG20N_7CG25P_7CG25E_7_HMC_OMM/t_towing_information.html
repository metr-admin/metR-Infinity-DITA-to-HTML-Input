            <p class="p">Personal injury or death could result when towing a disabled lift truck
               incorrectly.</p>
            <p class="p">Block the lift truck wheels to prevent movement before releasing the
               brakes. The lift truck can roll free if it is not blocked.</p>
            <p class="p">Follow the recommendations below, to properly perform the towing
               procedure.</p>
         </div></div>
         <p class="p">These towing instructions are for moving a disabled lift truck a
short distance, at low speed, no faster than 2 km/h (1.2 mph), to a
convenient location for repair. These instructions are for
emergencies only. Always haul the lift truck if long distance
moving is required.</p>
         <p class="p">Shield must be provided on the towing lift truck to protect the
operator if the tow line or bar should break.</p>
         <p class="p">Do not allow riders on the lift truck being towed unless the
operator can control the steering and/or braking.</p>
         <p class="p">Before towing, make sure the tow line or bar is in good
condition and has enough strength for the towing situation
involved. Use a towing line or bar with a strength of at least 1.5
times the gross weight of the towing lift truck for a disabled lift
truck stuck in the mud or when towing on a grade.</p>
         <p class="p">Keep the tow line angle to a minimum. Do not exceed a
30°angle from the straight ahead position. Connect the tow
line as low as possible on the lift truck that is being towed.</p>
         <p class="p">Quick lift truck movement could overload the tow line or bar and
cause it to break. Gradual and smooth lift truck movement will work
better.</p>
         <p class="p">Normally, the towing lift truck should be as large as the
disabled lift truck. Satisfy yourself that the towing lift truck
has enough brake capacity, weight and power, to control both lift
trucks for the grade and the distance involved.</p>
         <p class="p">To provide sufficient control and braking when moving a disabled
lift truck downhill, a larger towing lift truck or additional lift
trucks connected to the rear could be required. This will prevent
uncontrolled rolling.</p>
         <p class="p">The different situation requirements cannot be given, as minimal
towing lift truck capacity is required on smooth level surfaces to
maximum on inclines or poor surface conditions.</p>
         <p class="p">Consult your Time Lift Tuck branch for towing a disabled lift
truck.</p>
