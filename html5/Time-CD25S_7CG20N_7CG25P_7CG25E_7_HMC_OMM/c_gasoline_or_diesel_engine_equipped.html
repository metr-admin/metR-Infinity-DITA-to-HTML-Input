         <p class="p">Explosive fumes may be present during refueling.</p>
         <p class="p">Do not smoke in refueling areas.</p>
         <p class="p">Lift truck should be refueled only at designated safe locations. Safe outdoor
            locations are preferable to those indoors.</p>

         <p class="p">Do not allow the lift truck to become low on fuel or completely
                              run out of fuel. Sediment or other impurities in the fuel tank
                              could be drawn into the fuel system. This could result in difficult
                              starting or damage to components.</p>
         <p class="p">Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day of operation to drive
                              out moisture laden air and to prevent condensation.</p>
         <p class="p">In the cold weather, the moisture condensation can cause rust in
                              the fuel system and hard starting due to its freezing.</p>
         <p class="p">Do not fill the tank to the top. Fuel expands when it gets warm
                              and may overflow.</p>

      <p class="p">Park the lift truck only at a designated safe location. Place
the transmission in NEUTRAL. Lower the forks to the ground. Engage
the parking brake. Stop the engine.</p>

      <p class="p">Open the filter cap.</p>
      <p class="p">Fill the fuel tank slowly. Close the filter cap. If spillage
occurs, wipe off excess fuel and was down area with water.</p>
      <p class="p">Drain water and sediment from fuel tank as required by
prevailing conditions. Also, drain water and sediment from the main
fuel storage tank weekly and before the tank is refilled. This will
help prevent water or sediment being pumped from the storage tank
into the lift truck fuel tank.</p>
