   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The Fuel system has built-in diagnostics for system trouble
shooting. The system has a dash mounted malfunction indicator lamp
(MIL) that provides indications of engine or fuel system related
problem. Most engine control system related problems that affect
emissions or driveability of the vehicle will set a (DTC)
diagnostic trouble code and illuminate the MIL.</p>
      <p class="p">The MIL serves as notification to the operator of a problem
related to the emission control system so the driver can arrange
for service as soon as possible. It will also display DTCs that
have been stored due to a system malfunction.</p>
      <p class="p">The MIL should illuminate when the key is in the ON position and
the engine is not running. This feature verifies that the lamp is
in proper working order. If the MIL does not illuminate with the
vehicle key ON/engine OFF, repair it as soon as possible. Once the
engine is in start or run mode, the MIL should turn off. If the
lamp remains on while the engine is in the start or run mode a
diagnostic trouble code may be set.</p>
      <p class="p">The MIL will be turned OFF after three (3) consecutive run
cycles or by clearing the active code with the Diagnostic Scan Tool
(DST).</p>
      <p class="p">Diagnostic Trouble Codes are set when the GCP (Electronic
Control Module) runs a diagnostic self test and the test fails.
When a DTC is set, the ECM will illuminate the MIL on the
instrument panel and also save the DTC in memory. The ECM will
continue to run the self test. If the system continues to fail the
test, the lamp will stay illuminated and the DTC is stored as an
active DTC. If the self test runs and passes, the DTC will be
stored as historic DTC. All DTCs are stored as historic faults
until they are cleared. Most DTCs will automatically clear from
memory if the DTC does not reset within 50 to 100 consecutive
engine run cycles.</p>
      <p class="p">While a Diagnostic Trouble Code is current for a sensor, the ECM
may assign a default “limp home” value and use that
value in its control algorithms. All of the system diagnostic
self-tests run continuously during normal vehicle operation.</p>
      <p class="p">The Diagnostic Trouble Codes can be read by using either the MIL
lamp or a laptop computer. Diagnostic Trouble Codes can be cleared
from memory with a laptop computer, or by turning the ignition key
to the OFF position and removing the ECM power fuse or battery
cable for at least 15 seconds.</p>
      <p class="p">If more than one DTC is detected, start the diagnostic repair
with the lowest DTC number set. Diagnose each problem to correction
unless directed to do otherwise by the diagnostic chart. The DTCs
are numbered in order of importance. Both DTC 112 and DTC122
pertain to the oxygen sensor, so it is possible that a repair that
corrects DTC 112 may also correct the problem causing the DTC
122.</p>
      <p class="p">Diagnostic test charts contained in this manual refer to the DST
to be connected and in the “System Data Mode.” This
simply means that the DST is connected and communicating with the
PC. In some instances the chart will call out a special test mode.
An example of this would be instructions for the DST to be
connected and in the DBW (drive by wire) mode. Always be sure to
follow the special instructions to avoid a false diagnosis of fuel
system components.</p>
