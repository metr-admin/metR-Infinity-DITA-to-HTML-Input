   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The primary components of the fuel system are the fuel supply,
direct electronic pressure regulator (DEPR), fuel mixer, electronic
throttle control (ETC) device, 2-Stage convertor, engine control
module (ECM), and a catalytic converter. The system operates on a
slightly positive fuel pressure. Primary fuel pressure can be
measured at the LD 2-Stage convertor. Secondary fuel pressure
command and actual fuel pressure is monitored by the ECM.</p>
      <p class="p">To obtain maximum effect from the catalyst and accurate control
of the air fuel ratio, the emission certified engine is equipped
with an onboard computer or Engine Control Module (ECM). The ECM is
a 32 bit controller which receives input data from sensors mounted
to the engine and fuel system and then outputs various signals to
control engine operation.</p>
      <p class="p">One specific function of the controller is to maintain a closed
loop fuel control which is accomplished by use of the Heated
Exhaust Gas Oxygen sensor (HEGO) mounted in the exhaust system. The
HEGO sensor sends a voltage signal to the controller which then
outputs signals to the EPR to change the amount of fuel being
delivered from the regulator or mixer to the engine.</p>
      <p class="p">The controller also performs diagnostic functions on the fuel
system and notifies the operator of engine malfunctions by turning
on a Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) mounted in the dash.
Malfunctions in the system are identified by a Diagnostic Trouble
Code (DTC) number. In addition to notifying the operator of the
malfunction in the system, the controller also stores the
information about the malfunction in its memory. A technician can
than utilize a computerized diagnostic scan tool to retrieve the
stored diagnostic code and by using the diagnostic charts in this
manual to determine the cause of the malfunction. In the event a
technician does not have the computerized diagnostic tool, the MIL
light can be used to identify the diagnostic code to activate the
“blink” feature and count the number of blinks to
determine the diagnostic code number to locate the fault in the
system.</p>
      <p class="p">The primary components of the Gasoline Multi Point Fuel
Injection (MPFI) fuel system are the gasoline fuel tank, electric
fuel pump, fuel pressure and temperature sensor manifold, fuel
filter and fuel rail.</p>
      <p class="p">This engine is equipped with a fuel injector rail that does not
have a pressure regulator or a return circuit to the fuel tank.
Fuel pressure for this engine is regulated by the engine’s
ECM. The ECM receives fuel pressure and temperature feedback from
the gasoline fuel sensor manifold and uses this information to
control the ground side of the fuel pump. Fuel pressure is
regulated by the ECM pulse width modulating (PWM) the fuel pump.
The fuel pressure and temperature sensor manifold has a return or
“bleed” circuit that connects back to the equipment
fuel tank. This circuit is used to bleed off any vapor that
develops in the line and returns a small amount of fuel to the
tank. The fuel comes from the fuel tank and passes through the fuel
pump. Fuel exits the fuel pump, passes through the filter and then
enters the fuel pressure and temperature manifold assembly. Fuel
flows through the feed circuit and is delivered to the fuel
injector rail. Fuel that enters the bleed circuits through the
by-pass valve in the manifold is returned to the fuel tank.</p>
