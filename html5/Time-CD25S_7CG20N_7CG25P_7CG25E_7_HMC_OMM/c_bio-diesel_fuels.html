   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">In Europe and in the United States, as well as some other
countries, non-mineral oil based fuel resources such as RME
(Rapeseed Methyl Ester) and SOME (Soybean Methyl Ester),
collectively known as FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters), are being
used as extenders for mineral oil derived diesel fuels.</p>
      <p class="p">Time approves the use of bio-diesel fuels that do not exceed a
blend of 5% (by volume) of FAME with 95% (by volume) of approved
mineral oil derived diesel fuel. Such bio-diesel fuels are known in
the marketplace as B5 diesel fuels.</p>
      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">These 95 diesel fuels must meet certain requirements.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="p">The bio-fuels must meet the minimum specifications for the
country in which they are used.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
         <li class="li">In Europe, bio-diesel fuels must comply with the European
Standard EN14214.</li>
         <li class="li">In the United States, bio-diesel fuels must comply with the
American Standard ASTM D-6751.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">Bio-fuels should be purchased only from recognized and
authorised diesel fuel suppliers.</p>
      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">Precautions and concerns regarding the use of bio-fuels:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="p">Free methanol in FAME may result in corrosion of aluminum and
zinc FIE components.</p>
      <p class="p">Free water in FAME may result in plugging of fuel filters and
increased bacterial growth.</p>
      <p class="p">High viscosity at low temperatures may result in fuel delivery
problems, injection pump seizures, and poor injection nozzle spray
atomization.</p>
      <p class="p">FAME may have adverse effects on some elastomers (seal
materials) and may result in fuel leakage and dilution of the
engine lubricating oil.</p>
      <p class="p">Even bio-diesel fuels that comply with a suitable standard as
delivered, will require additional care and attention to maintain
the quality of the fuel in the equipment or other fuel tanks. It is
important to maintain a supply of clean, fresh fuel. Regular
flushing of the fuel system, and / or fuel storage containers, may
be necessary.</p>
      <p class="p">The use of bio-diesel fuels that do not comply with the
standards as agreed to by the diesel engine manufacturers and the
diesel fuel injection equipment manufacturers, or biodiesel fuels
that have degraded as per the precautions and concerns above, may
affect the warranty coverage of your engine.</p>
