      <p class="- topic/p ">Intake air is compressed and generates heat by the 1st stage air-end, and pressure builds
            up to approximately 2.0 bar (29 psi).</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The heated air is cooled down to atmospheric temperature +15 ℃ (27 ℉) by the inter-cooler
            and then further compressed and heated again by the 2nd stage air-end as pressure builds
            up to the rated pressure level of the DSP air compressor.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The re-heated air passes through the check valve to the after-cooler, where the
            compressed air is cooled down to atmospheric temperature +15 ℃ (27 ℉), eventually being
            supplied to the plant air piping.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The oil sump is located in the bottom of the gear case. Oil is sucked through an oil
            strainer (oil strainer has a 120-mesh filter screen) by the oil pump and is
            hydraulically fed to the oil cooler where it is cooled. During the cooling process, oil
            passes through the high- precision oil filter and is then injected onto the bearings of
            the 1st and 2nd stage air-ends as well as the step-up gears. Eventually oil returns to
            the oil sump, where it will continue to circulate in the lubricating system.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Cooling air is inhaled from the right and left panels of the enclosure and removes the
            heat from the air-cooled oil cooler, inter-cooler, after-cooler and Hi-precooler.
            Eventually, this exchanged heat air is exhaled from the grill on the top of the
            enclosure.</p>
